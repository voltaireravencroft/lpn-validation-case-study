Root Cause Analysis
5 Whys
1.	Why are pallets being mis-scanned?
2.	Why does the system allow incorrect LPNs?
3.	Why isn’t syntax validated?
4.	Why do new hires not catch visual differences?
5.	Why is there no re-scan safeguard?

Contributing Factors

•	high-volume dock pressure

•	visually similar barcodes

•	no validation logic

•	new hire learning curve

Assumptions

•	LPN prefix standards are consistent and centrally maintained

•	Approved prefix list can be updated without code changes

•	Scanning hardware remains unchanged

Constraints

•	No WMS vendor replacement

•	Minimal impact to scan time

•	Solution must function under peak dock volume
