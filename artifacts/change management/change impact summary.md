Change Impact Summary

Project: Inbound Receiving Optimization — LPN Syntax Validation Enhancement

________________________________________
Overview
This enhancement delivers a low-risk, high-value improvement to receiving accuracy by preventing mis-scans at the point of entry while preserving efficiency for valid transactions.
________________________________________
Who Changes Behavior

•	Receiving Associates: Prompted to re-scan when a potential mis-scan is detected.

•	Supervisors / Leads: Review mis-scan warnings and apply overrides in rare exceptions.
________________________________________
Scope of Change

•	Adds LPN prefix validation and re-scan confirmation on exception only.

•	Prevents confirmation of mismatched LPN scans.

•	Does not alter the standard (“happy path”) receiving workflow.

•	Does not impact unloading, staging, putaway, staffing, or throughput.
________________________________________
Training & Operational Risk

•	Minimal training required due to intuitive system messaging.

•	Validation appears only on exception cases.

•	Risk limited to edge cases involving unexpected LPN formats.

•	Supervisor override mitigates potential blocking scenarios.

•	No system downtime, data migration, or upstream/downstream impact.
